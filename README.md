GitHub is a web-based version control and collaboration platform for software developers. Microsoft, the biggest single contributor to GitHub, acquired the platform for $7.5 billion in 2018. GitHub, which is delivered through a software as a service (SaaS) business model, was started in 2008. It was founded on Git, an open source code management system created by Linus Torvalds to make software builds faster.

## How to start collaborative project on Github
***

### 1. Create a New Repository
### 2. Invite Collaborators
- In the repository you just created, go to "Settings."
- In the left sidebar, click on "Manage access."
- Click the "Invite a collaborator" button and enter the GitHub username or email address of the people you want to invite.  

The invited collaborators will receive an email notification, and once they accept the invitation, they can contribute to the project

 
 ### 3. Setting Up Local Development Environment
- Collaborators should clone the repository to their local machines using git clone <repository-url>.
- They can then create a new branch for their work using git checkout -b branch-name.
- After making changes, they commit and push their changes to their branch.

### 4. Contributing Code
- Collaborators can now work on their respective branches, making changes, adding features, or fixing bugs.
- Once they are ready to contribute their changes back to the main repository, they create a Pull Request (PR) from their branch to the main branch (usually main or master).
- The PR serves as a request to merge their changes into the main branch.

### 5. Reviewing and Merging PRs
- Repository maintainers and other collaborators can review the code changes in the PR.
- They can provide feedback, request changes, or approve the PR depending on the quality and suitability of the changes.
- Once the PR is approved, a maintainer can merge it into the main branch, incorporating the changes into the project.

### 6. Continuous Collaboration
- The process of creating branches, making changes, and submitting PRs continues for ongoing collaborative development.
- Regular communication, code reviews, and adherence to coding standards help maintain a healthy and productive collaboration.  

>***Remember that collaborative projects work best when there is clear communication, a well-defined project structure, and a shared understanding of project goals. Using issues to track tasks, maintaining a good README file, and setting up continuous integration can also contribute to the project's success***
